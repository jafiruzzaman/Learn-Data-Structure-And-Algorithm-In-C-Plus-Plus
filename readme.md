# 🚀 **DSA Mastery Roadmap (C++ – FAANG Preparation)**

This repository documents my complete journey to mastering **Data Structures & Algorithms in C++**, following the best resources available, completing top DSA sheets, and preparing for **FAANG-level** coding interviews.

The goal of this repository is to maintain a **clean, structured, and consistent** progress log with high-quality C++ implementations, notes, and problem-solving patterns.

---

## 🎯 **Objectives**

* Build strong command over **C++ DSA + STL**
* Solve **400–500** high-quality DSA problems
* Complete major DSA sheets (Striver, Love Babbar, Apna College)
* Master patterns: **Binary Search**, **Two Pointers**, **Sliding Window**, **DP**, **Recursion**, **Graphs**
* Prepare for **FAANG Online Assessments**, **LLD**, and **HLD**

---

# 📘 **Learning Sources & Structure**

This journey follows a hybrid structure using the **best instructors for each topic**:

---

## ✅ **1. Arrays + Binary Search — *Striver (Take U Forward*)**

Topics:

* Array basics
* Prefix / Suffix / Sliding Window
* Kadanes
* Two-pointers
* Sorting-based tricks
* Binary Search
* BS on answers (Koko Bananas, Aggressive Cows, Allocate Books, etc.)
* Rotated sorted array
* Searching patterns

> Reason: Striver explains array patterns & binary search better than anyone.

---

## ✅ **2. Core DSA (Recursion → Trees → AVL) — *Coder Army (163 Videos Series)***

Exact topics covered:

* Recursion + Backtracking
* Pointers in C++
* Sorting Algorithms (Basic + Advanced)
* Strings
* OOP Concepts
* Linked List
* Stack
* Queue
* Binary Tree
* Binary Search Tree
* **AVL Trees**
* Hashing
* Heaps
* Graphs

> Reason: Coder Army covers DSA in a structured & implementation-heavy way (best for C++ mastery).

---

## ✅ **3. Basic Sorting — *Apna College***

Topics:

* Bubble, Selection, Insertion
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Counting Sort
* Time complexity intuition for sorting

> Reason: Very clear basics with strong intuition.

---

## ✅ **4. Dynamic Programming — *Aditya Verma (DP Playlist)***

DP Topics:

* DP on subsequences
* DP on grids
* Unbounded knapsack
* LCS patterns
* LIS
* Partition DP
* Matrix chain multiplication
* DP patterns recognized in FAANG interviews

> Reason: AV is the best for **core DP intuition**.

---

## ✅ **5. Problem Sheets I Will Complete**

### 📌 **Striver SDE Sheet**

* 180+ curated problems
* Covers entire DSA + interview patterns

### 📌 **Love Babbar DSA Sheet**

* 450 questions
* Good for coverage + variety

### 📌 **Apna College DSA Sheet**

* Beginner-friendly + pattern-based
* Good for consistency

> I will solve problems topic-wise and add all solutions with notes to this repository.
